			<p>Hi there, I’m Matt! I’m a scientist researching biological physics: basically, I focus on using quantitative tools from physics and mathematics to try to understand complex problems in biology. I’m especially interested in nonequilibrium settings where stochastic fluctuations are important, like the interior of the cell, but more broadly interested in any and all settings where physics meets biology. If any of what I'm working on sounds interesting, feel free to get in touch -- I’m always happy to talk science with curious people!

			<h4>Brief Bio</h4>
			<p>I’m currently an independent postdoctoral fellow at Yale University, and also hold a guest researcher appointment at the Flatiron Institute. Previously I earned my PhD in physics at Simon Fraser University under professor <a href="http://davidsivak.com/">David Sivak</a>, during which time I also helped co-found <a href="https://www.ondeck.fish/">OnDeck AI</a> with a couple of my best friends. Before that I studied physics and mathematics at Dalhousie University, where I learned the ropes of biophysics research from professor <a href="https://rutengroup.ca/">Andrew Rutenberg</a>, and before that I <a href="https://www.vancouverisawesome.com/courier-archive/sports/cross-country-shoeless-kitsilano-runners-bare-their-soles-3021263">grew up</a> in Vancouver, Canada.

			<h4>Research Overview</h4>
				
			<p>My <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j-Yk0HYAAAAJ&hl=en">published research</a> to date explores topics such as the thermodynamics of energy conversion by nanoscale molecular machines, how collective behaviour of motor proteins facilitates intracellular transport, and the structure and mechanics of collagen fibrils. I’ve got a lot of exciting work in the pipeline as well, with preprints hopefully coming soon, including (but by no means limited to):

			<ul>
				<li>Interpreting neural activity patterns in the hippocampus, </li>

				<li>Exploring the non-markovian dynamics of animal behaviour, </li>

				<li>Learning how to recover equilibrium protein structure ensembles from cryo-EM data, </li>

				<li>Developing tools to quantify information flows in collective bacterial chemotaxis, </li>

				<li>Uncovering how thermodynamic considerations shape mitochondrial geometry, and </li>

				<li>Developing computational models for hierarchical protein fibers with the Impossible Fibers program at <a href="https://spec.tech">Speculative Technologies</a>. </li>
			</ul>

			<p>My current work is funded by a combination of fellowships and grants from <a href="https://physics.yale.edu/opportunities/yale-mossman">Yale</a>, <a href="https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/PD-NP/cpra-bprc_eng.asp">NSERC</a>, and <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/about/offices/bto">DARPA</a>.

			<h4>Other Interests</h4>
			<p>When I'm not doing science, I like to spend my time:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Skiing:</strong> I've loved skiing pretty much all my life. Whenever time, weather, and my location allow I can be found in the mountains shredding gnar and schlarping pow! I'm a certified ski instructor (CSIA Level 1), and I am trained in avalanche risk evaluation and rescue (AST 1).</li>

				<li><strong>Music:</strong> I've had a strong passion for classical choral music as long as I can remember, and have been singing in choirs since the age of 5. I've performed as a soloist with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, the Victoria Philharmonic Orchestra, the Vancouver Bach Choir, and others. During my time in Halifax I sang as a choral scholar with the University of King's College Chapel Choir directed by Paul Halley. You can listen to recordings of some of our concerts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kingschapelchoir">here</a>. I also have formal training in Piano and Music Theory (both RCM 8).</li>

				<li><strong>Running:</strong> My first three years at Dalhousie I was a member of the varsity track team. I specialized in middle distance events, and won a number of individual medals and team championships in the Atlantic University Sport (AUS) league over my time with the team.
				I left in my fourth year in order to free up time to pursue other interests, but still run regularly to stay in shape.</li>
				
				<li><strong>Surfing:</strong> A newer hobby. During my PhD I had the good fortune of living within weekend-trip-distance of some of Canada’s best surf beaches on the west coast of Vancouver Island, and took advantage whenever possible.</li>

				<li><strong>Sailing:</strong> I learned to sail as a teenager on a beaten-up 40-year old Laser my friends and I bought together, and have loved the sport ever since. I had the opportunity to get a couple weeks of training in keelboat racing from members of the French national sailing team as part of a <a href="http://teranano7.lpa.ens.fr/spip.php?article2370&lang=en">physics summer school</a> in 2023, and have lately been working on levelling up at windsurfing and wingfoiling.</li>
